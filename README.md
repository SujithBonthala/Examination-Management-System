# Examination-Management-System

### A mini-project implemented as part of 'Problem Solving with C' course in Semester-II

We have designed an examination management system where one can login as an admin, a student or a teacher. Playfair cipher is used for securing the admin account, where the message is the username and key is the password.

Admin Credentials :
Username - Playfair cipher for encryption
Password - I am the admin

The admin can create student and teacher accounts and can search, update and delete those accounts. The admin can also set examination for students of a particular semester.

The student account once created by the admin will have the username and the password to be set as the SRN of the student. The student, once logged in can change their password, view their attendance details, view their results, view their course details and view their exam seat allotment course-wise.

The teacher account once created by the admin will have the username and the password to be set as the PRN of the teacher. The teacher, once logged in can change their password, give attendance to students and can also give grades to students.

Branches used in the examination system - Computer Science and Engineering, Electronics and Communication Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Civil Engineering, Biotechnology Engineering.
